							--Applied Term--<br>
							Optimum arousal theory<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This theory shows us<br>
							that we consistently <br>strive to be the best<br>
							version of ourselves, or<br> in this case, the<br>
							strongest version of ourselves.<br>
							In this verse, X <br>shows us just how angry<br>
							and fed up he is with the<br> way the world is,<br>
							and that he's just <br>going to go on a "rampage"<br>
							so to speak. <br>This verse is obviously very inflammatory,<br>
							so he's showing us <br>how he really just doesn't<br>
							care anymore <br>about other's feelings.<br>

							--Applied Term--<br>
							S███al Response Cycle<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							My term choice will make much more sense<br>
							if you know what the song is about, so<br>
							allow me to explain... the song "Eat It Up"<br>
							by X is about, well, "eating {somebody} out".<br>
							This song is about an interaction that X had<br>
							with an unnamed girl, and the song focuses on<br>
							how she felt during this, well, interaction.<br>
							Oddly, the song follows (with near perfection)<br>
							the stages of the se**al response cycle...<br>
							although it is too vulgar for this class<br>
							(thus why it's not included here), there's<br>
							a section in this song that focuses exclusively<br>
							on female or**sms... Still a good song though.<br>

							Neophobia<br><br>

							--Term Explanation--<br>
							This song, according to the experts,<br>
							is most likely directed towards his ex<br>
							girlfriend, and the trouble their relationship<br>
							went through. This song is literally about<br>
							changes, and how he doesn't know if the world<br>

							song, with a deep meaning, and it connects<br>
							perfectly into neophobia, commonly defined as<br>
